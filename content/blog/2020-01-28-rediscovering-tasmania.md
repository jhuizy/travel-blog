Our 6 weeks in Tassie have flown by! Family catchups, relaxation and being back to work (for Jordan) has filled our time here very quickly.

It has been lovely to finally spend a decent amount of time in Tassie. Usually its just a quick fly-in fly-out visit for a family occasion.

Being here for a decent amount of time has allowed us to be able to do a bit of sight seeing, even managing to get down to St Helens, Hobart, and even Cradle Mountain.

We arrived in Tassie just in time to celebrate New Years. We celebrated very traditionally, whipping up some fresh oliebollen.
