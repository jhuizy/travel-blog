Our 6 weeks in Tassie have flown by! Family catchups, relaxation and being back to work (for Jordan) has filled our time here very quickly.

It has been lovely to finally spend a decent amount of time in Tassie. Usually its just a quick fly-in fly-out visit for a family occasion.

Being here for a decent amount of time has allowed us to be able to do a bit of sight seeing, even managing to get down to St Helens, Hobart, and even Cradle Mountain.

We arrived in Tassie just in time to celebrate New Years. We celebrated very traditionally, whipping up some fresh oliebollen.

*Dad‚Äôs oliebollen never disappoint üòã* 

To pass the time we then thought we‚Äôd check out what Beerfest had to offer, which, we soon found out wasn‚Äôt much. But while the beer was a little disappointing at least we had good company.

While Jordan still had some time off from work we ventured down to the east coast town of St Helens.

Since our last visit, [mountain biking](https://www.sthelensmtbtrails.com.au/) has become a large attraction in St Helens. Enjoying a bit of adventure, we thought we‚Äôd give it a go.

We hired our bikes from [Giant St Helens](https://www.giantsthelens.com), Unfortunately they were out of e-bikes but we were happy with the Rein 29 and eager to to go try them out on the trails.

We rode from town up to the flagstaff trail head and we soon worked out why the shop had no e-bikes left to hire out ü•µ 

While the trails were mostly composed of uphill climbs, and quite challenging, we still had a very enjoyable day riding around.

We ventured down to Hobart staying in a lovely [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/30115761?source_impression_id=p3_1580184016_pfL4kcZKXKl3%2FHCg). Unfortunately the festive season had come to an end so Jordan set up his office and got to work.

I spent some time with my parents shopping and exploring around Hobart.

Mum and I had a day to ourselves so took the time to wonder down to the [Westerway Raspberry Farm](https://www.lanoma.com.au). Here we could pick our own berries. Such a worthwhile drive for some delicious fresh berries.

We headed back up to Launceston and continued to find things to do to pass the days.

January 11th we thought we‚Äôd check out what the locals were doing at the Carrick Rodeo. It was an entertainment filled night filled with ‚Äòoohs‚Äô ‚Äòahhhhs‚Äô and ‚ÄòOUCHes‚Äô.

Making the most of the berry season mum and I woke up early one morning (too early for the boys) to cash in on the first day of blueberry picking at [Crestview Blueberries](https://www.facebook.com/Crestview-Blueberries-835034803205526/). Safe to say we picked our year‚Äôs supply of blueberries, and it only took an hour!üòÑ

Saturday 18th January: It was mentioned to Jordan and I, that to prepare for our South American trekking we‚Äôd better do the Zigzag and Duckreach Tracks at The Gorge. So that‚Äôs exactly what we did. We got together our day bags and set off for a nice walk through the Gorge.

We decided that if our South American Hikes are similar we will be just fine.

So we booked some accomodation and took a road trip to Cradle Mountain.
