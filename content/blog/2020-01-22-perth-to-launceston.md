4328 km later, seeing countless number of kangaroos, hours of sitting in the car, numerous slow caravan drivers, 7 apostles, 4 motels, 2 koalas, a giant galah, a dingo, an emu, a giant lobster and a camel we have made it to little old Launceston. So lets fill you in on how the rest of the road trip went:

After the stress from the past month, packing, selling, cleaning, open homes and quitting jobs it was nice to take some time to relax and explore our first stop: Esperance. To be honest it was just wonderful to have a proper bed to sleep on after weeks of sleeping on an air mattress. Lilly was happy she could stretch her legs, so we left her to go explore what Esperance had to offer.

On some recommendations we checked out Twilight beach and Lucky bay. The beaches of Esperance are very highly rated and from the little time we spent there it was easy to see why. Beautiful squeaky, fine, white sand, kangaroos on the beach and crystal clear water. Just a pity we didn‚Äôt have a 4WD to be able to explore more and drive on the beach.

Jordan was so excited to to visit the Pink Lake. But upon arrival it was the biggest disappointment. He still managed to smile for the photo though. 

After a day of exploring we drove to Norseman to charge our batteries ready to start the long drive.

Today we were very fortunate the Nullarbor had reopened so didn‚Äôt waist any time. Up and about early, we powered on over the Nullarbor driving 13 hours from Norseman to Ceduna. 

Looking back I‚Äôm extremely glad we drove West to East, doing the ‚Äòboring‚Äô part first. We were both excited to see what this Nullarbor was all about so the time passed very quickly over the miles and miles of nothing. 

We did all the touristy musts; photos at the boarders (even Lilly managed to get in a few snapsüê∞), stopped at a couple of road houses and all the lookouts along the Great Australian Bight. Unfortunately the weather wasn‚Äôt very nice so there wasn‚Äôt a great deal to see but we took the opportunity to stretch our legs nonetheless.

Due to the rain there were kangaroos EVERYWHERE. Clearly it hadn‚Äôt rained for a while and they all thought it was a great opportunity to have a nice drink off the road. While this was pretty cool to see, it slowed our driving down considerably. However, after (to our surprise) very easily passing through quarantine with Lilly, we arrived in Ceduna just in time for our Christmas Eve tradition - watching the carols on TV üéÑüéÖüé∂

Christmas Day. Following our 13 hour long drive the day before, our scheduled 8 hour drive to Adelaide today sounded like a breeze. But boy were we wrong! 

Coupled with fatigue and Christmas Day blues, the hours dragged. And after what seemed a decade, split by a visit to streaky bay, lunch and a quick snap with the giant galah, we arrived safely in Adelaide.

After a day of peanut butter sandwiches and servo pies we were extremely thankful to find a restaurant open, so regenerated our Christmas spirit over a nice Christmas dinner.

Our planed day in Adelaide came just in time. No driving today! YAY!

We spent Boxing Day exploring the city, doing some sales shopping and just enjoying being able to stretch our legs. 

We found the most amazing Teddy bear shop ever! Not ashamed to say we spent most of the day in here üòÇ

We hopped back in the car with the hope that driving would be better today as we were heading along the coast. Thankfully it was. 

We passed through Hahndorf, stopped at cheese world, and a quick google made it clear that there were some unmissable sights along the way in Mount Gambier, so of course we had to visit! 

First stop in Mt Gambier: the Blue Lake.\
We turned up with low expectations after seeing the Pink Lake in Esperance but were pleased to be met by the vibrant blue waters of the historic volcano.

Second sight: the Umpherston Sinkhole.\
A sinkhole? Yes, someone in our car was also not very impressed to be going to visit a sinkhole. But, upon arrival it was clear it was no ordinary Baldivis car park sinkhole. It‚Äôs a huge sinkhole which has been turned into spectacular gardens, with walkways and caves inside. Well worth a visit if you are ever in the area!

We started the next day with a stop off at Port fairy. Such a cute town!

We walked around the enjoying the cute little cafes and a farmers market that was on. This was one of my (Claire‚Äôs) favourite places along the way. It‚Äôs a super cute little town with beautiful beaches and would be a fantastic camping spot.

We continued onto the Great Ocean Road, and talk about busy! We battled the crowds and heat to get a few snaps of the remaining 7 Apostles, The Grotto, London Arch, Loch Ard Gorge, Bay Of Martyrs and the Bay Of Islands.

We even managed to spot some koalas in the Otway national park which made us both very excited. 

We ended our day arriving safely at our Airbnb in Melbourne.

We enjoyed a full day relaxing in Melbourne before sailing the Bass Straight south, safely arriving at our end point for our first leg of our journey on the 30th Dec ‚Äò19; Launceston, Tasmania.
