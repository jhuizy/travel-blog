Making the most of the Australia Day long weekend we took a road trip to visit Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park. We loaded up our packs and headed off to test our our newly purchased gear (and our legs).

We had been watching the weather for the past week wondering if it was worth heading down to Cradle Mountain. Jordan had never seen that side of Tassie and we wanted to try out some of the gear we had purchased for our upcoming trip. Even though the weather was looking a little glum we decided to go anyway, so booked some accomodation and set off.

We arrived late Friday night, checked the BOM radar and were happy to see the precipitation forecast for Saturday was 0mm. With our sites set on hiking the summit we got our day packs ready and got in a good nights sleep ready for our big hike early the next morning.

Excited, we woke early on Saturday ready to conquer Cradle Mountain. After a good breakfast we drove to the visitors centre where we boarded the shuttle bus to take us into the park. Ronny Creek was our first stop where we planned to start our hike. It was clear already here, when we hopped off the bus, that we hadn’t picked the nicest day for a walk. But we were in the park, excited and prepared so we registered our walk and set off anyway.

We headed along the Overland track, past Crater Falls and stopped on Wombat Peak for some morning tea. At this point there were some low lying clouds hanging about so we couldn’t see the top of the mountains but could still over look Lake Lilla and Dove Lake.

As we continued on to Marions Lookout the clouds began to close in. By the time we reached the lookout we couldn’t even see Dove Lake!

But we remained hopeful to reach the summit knowing that the weather can change in a matter of minutes. After all, this is Tasmania!

The weather did change, but not in our favour. It started pouring down! So we got out our wet weather gear and marched on.

At this point the rain had set in. The tracks were starting to become rivers and visibility was very low. Dispite this our wet weather gear was doing it’s job fantastically. We were still pretty dry and arriving at Kitchen Hut put a smile back on our faces.

From Kitchen Hut it is a further 2.5hrs to the summit and back. We started walking up the track but 15 minutes in it was apparent that the rain was only going to get worse the higher we climbed. And to top it off half the track was underwater. So we made the executive decision to turn back. We were not going to conquer the summit today.
