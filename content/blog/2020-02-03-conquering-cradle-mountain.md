Making the most of the Australia Day long weekend we took a road trip to visit Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park. We loaded up our packs and headed off to test our our newly purchased gear (and our legs).

We had been watching the weather for the past week wondering if it was worth heading down to Cradle Mountain. Jordan had never seen that side of Tassie and we wanted to try out some of the gear we had purchased for our upcoming trip. Even though the weather was looking a little glum we decided to go anyway, so booked some accomodation and set off.

We arrived late Friday night, checked the BOM radar and were happy to see the precipitation forecast for saturday was 0mm. With our sites set on hiking the summit we got our day packs ready and got in a good nights sleep ready for our big hike early the next morning.

Excited, we woke early on Saturday ready to conquer Cradle Mountain. After a good breakfast we drove to the visitors centre where we boarded the shuttle bus to take us into the park. Ronny Creek was our first stop where we planned to starot our hike. It was clear already here when we hopped off the bus that we hadnâ€™t picked the nicest day for a walk, but we were already there excited and prepared so we registered our walk and set off anyway.
