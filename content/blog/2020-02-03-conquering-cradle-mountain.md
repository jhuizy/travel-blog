Making the most of the Australia Day long weekend we took a road trip to visit Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park. We loaded up our packs and headed off to test our our newly purchased gear (and our legs). 

- - -

We had been watching the weather for the past week wondering if it was worth heading down to Cradle Mountain. Jordan had never seen that side of Tassie and we wanted to try out some of the gear we had purchased for our upcoming trip. Even though the weather was looking a little glum we decided to go anyway, so booked some accomodation and set off.

We arrived late Friday night, checked the BOM radar and were happy to see the precipitation forecast for Saturday was 0mm. With our sites set on hiking the summit we got our day packs ready and got in a good nights sleep ready for our big hike early the next morning.

Excited, we woke early on Saturday ready to conquer Cradle Mountain. After a good breakfast we drove to the visitors centre where we boarded the shuttle bus to take us into the park. Ronny Creek was our first stop where we planned to start our hike. It was clear already here, when we hopped off the bus, that we hadnâ€™t picked the nicest day for a walk. But we were in the park, excited and prepared so we registered our walk and set off anyway.

We headed along the Overland track, past Crater Falls and stopped on Wombat Peak for some morning tea. At this point there were some low lying clouds hanging about so we couldnâ€™t see the top of the mountains but could still over look Lake Lilla and Dove Lake.

As we continued on to Marions Lookout the clouds began to close in. By the time we reached the lookout we couldnâ€™t even see Dove Lake!

But we remained hopeful to reach the summit knowing that the weather can change in a matter of minutes. After all, this is Tasmania!

The weather did change, but not in our favour. It started pouring down! So we got out our wet weather gear and marched on.

At this point the rain had set in. The tracks were starting to become rivers and visibility was very low. Dispite this our wet weather gear was doing itâ€™s job fantastically. We were still pretty dry and arriving at Kitchen Hut put a smile back on our faces.

From Kitchen Hut it is a further 2.5hrs to the summit and back. We started walking up the track but 15 minutes in it was apparent that the rain was only going to get worse the higher we climbed. And to top it off half the track was underwater. So we made the executive decision to turn back. We were not going to conquer the summit today.

At this stage we had already been waking for over 2.5hrs. We were starting to get cold and were ready to start heading back. We started heading along the Face Track, planning on making our way back to the Dove Lake bus stop to get a ride back to our car. 

The Face Track was hard. It was very steep and slowed us down considerably. But this let us stop and admire what was around us. The low lying clouds and rain made the summit look absolutely amazing from down below. 

It reminded us why we love hiking so much. While it may be hard, the view is ALWAYS worth it. It lets you appreciate the amazing creation we have around us and allows you to see the almighty power of our God in this world.

We went down to Dove Lake via Lake Wilks. As we descended, the weather cleared up, the rain stoped and we could enjoy finishing our hike with a pleasant walk around Dove lake.

4hrs 30min and 13.10km we arrived back at the bus at Dove lake. We headed back to our accomodation to relax for the afternoon to ready see what the next day of adventuring would bring.

The next day we took it easy in the morning. Sleeping in and reviving our energy from the day before. Seeing that it was still cloudy we decided to put our mountain sightings on hold for the morning and decided to check our the Leven Canyon Regional Reserve.

It had been a few years since weâ€™d ventured out this far but its worth the extra hours drive. Although it was Freezing, the weather was clearing up and we got a great view of the canyon.

The weather was clearing up and we got a great view of the canyon. 

After some lunch and a nice coffee we made our way back into the national park to see if the mountain would show its face today. And we were happy to see it had!

Making the most of the good weather we headed from Dove Lake along Wombat Pool Track and up to Marions lookout once again. Today the view was much more spectacular than yesterday! We now understood why itâ€™s one of the most popular treks at cradle mountain.

From Marions lookout we walked back around to Crater Lake, back along a section of the Overland Track to Ronny Creek. We were pleasantly surprised to see some of the local wildlife out and about on our way back.

We ended todays walk at Ronny Creek,  caught the bus back to our car and headed back to the hotel to call it a day.

*The Adventures of Day 2*

- - -

Making the most of our last day we packed our day bags and once again headed to Cradle Mountain. Todayâ€™s plan was to tackle Hansons Peak. 

We took the shuttle bus to Dove Lake and started hiking from there. Learning from the last two days we came prepared! Gloves, beanies, layers, comfy socks, we were ready for a good day of hiking.

Although the clouds were still over Cradle Mountain, the view from Hansons Peak were amazing: Not only looking towards Cradle Mountain but also back towards Mt Emmett.

From Hansons Peak we condinued on back down the other side, up little horn and stopping for our classic banana and peanut butter sandwich lunch.

Taking the same route as Saturday, we walked down past Lake Wilks back down to Dove lake. It was great to actually be able to see more than 2m in front of us and be able take in the view ðŸ˜‚

By the time we got back around Dove Lake to the boat shed she clouds had completely cleared, the sun was out and we were able to get the classic Cradle Mountain photo.

We said our goodbyes to Cradle Mountain, boarded the bus back to our car and headed back home.
