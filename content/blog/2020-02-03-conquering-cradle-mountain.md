Making the most of the Australia Day long weekend we took a road trip to visit Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park. We loaded up our packs and headed off to test our our newly purchased gear (and our legs).

We had been watching the weather for the past week wondering if it was worth heading down to Cradle Mountain. Jordan had never seen that side of Tassie and we wanted to try out some of the gear we had purchased for our upcoming trip. Even though the weather was looking a little glum we decided to go anyway, so booked some accomodation and set off.

We arrived late Friday night, checked the BOM radar and were happy to see the precipitation forecast for Saturday was 0mm. With our sights set on hiking the summit we got our day packs ready and got in a good nights sleep ready for our big hike early the next morning.

Excited, we woke early on Saturday ready to conquer Cradle Mountain. After a good breakfast we drove to the visitors centre where we boarded the shuttle bus to take us into the park. 

Ronny Creek was our first stop where we planned to start our hike. It was clear already here, when we hopped off the bus, that we hadn’t picked the nicest day for a walk and the weather forecast we read was wrong. But we were in the park, excited and prepared so we registered our walk and set off anyway.

We headed along part of the Overland Track, past Crater Falls and stopped on Wombat Peak for some morning tea. At this point there were some low lying clouds hanging about so we couldn’t see the top of the mountains but could still over look Lake Lilla and Dove Lake.

As we continued on to Marions Lookout the clouds began to close in. By the time we reached the lookout we couldn’t even see Dove Lake!

But we remained hopeful to reach the summit knowing that the weather can change in a matter of minutes. After all, this is Tasmania!

The weather did change, but not in our favour. It started pouring down! So we got out our wet weather gear and marched on.

*The tracks were turning very muddy, lucky we have good boots!*

At this point the rain had set in. The tracks were starting to become rivers and visibility was very low. Despite this our wet weather gear was doing it’s job fantastically. We were still pretty dry and arriving at Kitchen Hut put a smile back on our faces.

From Kitchen Hut it is a further 2.5hrs to the summit and back. We started walking up the track but 15 minutes in it was apparent that the rain was only going to get worse the higher we climbed. And to top it off, half the track was underwater. So we made the executive decision to turn back. We were not going to conquer the summit today.

At this stage we had already been waking for over 2.5hrs. We were starting to get cold and were ready to start heading back. We started walking back along the Face Track, planning on making our way back to the Dove Lake bus stop to get a ride back to our car.

*The steep terrain* 

The Face Track was hard. It was very steep and slowed us down considerably. But this let us stop and admire what was around us. The low lying clouds and rain made the summit look absolutely amazing from down below.

We went down to Dove Lake via Lake Wilks. As we descended, the weather cleared up, the rain stoped and we could enjoy finishing our hike with a pleasant walk around Dove lake.

4hrs 30min and 13.10km we arrived back at the bus at Dove Lake. We headed back to our accomodation to relax and rejuvenate for the afternoon, ready see what the next day of adventuring would bring.

The next day we took it easy in the morning. Sleeping in and reviving our energy from the day before. Seeing that it was still cloudy we decided to put our mountain sightings on hold for the morning and went to check our the Leven Canyon Regional Reserve.

It had been a few years since we’d ventured out this far but its worth the extra hours drive. Although it was freezing, the weather was clearing up and we got a great view of the canyon.

*A short 10 min walk takes you to the canyon view point*

After some lunch and a nice coffee we made our way back into the Cradle Mountain national park to see if the mountain would show its face. We were happy to see that there was far less cloud hanging about today.

*Happy to get his first glimpse at Cradle Mountain*

Making the most of the good weather we headed from Dove Lake along Wombat Pool Track and up to Marions lookout once again. Today the view was much more spectacular than yesterday! We now understood why it’s one of the most popular walks at Cradle Mountain.

*The view from Marions Lookout*

From Marions Lookout we walked back around to Crater Lake, back along a section of the Overland Track to Ronny Creek. We were pleasantly surprised to see some of the local wildlife out and about on our way back.

We ended todays walk at Ronny Creek, caught the bus back to our car and headed back to the hotel to call it a day.

Making the most of our last day we organised our day packs and once again headed to Cradle Mountain. Today’s plan was to tackle Hansons Peak. Learning from the past two days we came prepared! Gloves, beanies, layers of clothes and comfy socks; we were ready for a good day of hiking. 

We took the shuttle bus to Dove Lake and started hiking from there.

*Heading up to Hansons Peak*

Although the clouds were still over Cradle Mountain, the view from Hansons Peak was amazing; Not only looking towards Cradle Mountain but also back towards Mt Emmett.

From Hansons Peak we continued on, back down the other side, up Little Horn and stopping for our classic banana and peanut butter sandwich lunch.

Taking the same route as Saturday, we walked down past Lake Wilks back down to Dove Lake. It was great to actually be able to see more than 2 meters in front of us and be able take in the scenery 😂

By the time we got back around Dove Lake to the boat shed the clouds had completely cleared, the sun was out and we were able to get the classic Cradle Mountain Snaps we came for.

After another big day of hiking we said our goodbyes to Cradle Mountain, boarded the bus back to our car and headed home, back to Launceston.

*The Adventures of Day 3*

Although we weren’t able to climb to the summit of Cradle Mountain we did not leave disappointed. There are so many different tracks and walks you can do around the mountain that all have beautiful views. Even though it was raining on our first day of hiking it was by far our most enjoyable day. Walking in the rain was the most amazing experience, although we couldn’t see the classic views of the mountain the sights we saw were breath taking. 

We were reminded why we love hiking so much. While it may be tough at times, the view is ALWAYS worth it. It lets you appreciate the amazing creation we have around us and allows you to see the Almighty Power of our God in this world. We will definitely be visiting Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park again when we are back in the state and recommend anyone visiting Tasmania to take the time to go visit. 

> “God created everything in the heavenly realms and on earth. He made the things we can see and the things we can’t see - such as thrones, kingdoms, rulers, and authorities in the unseen world. Everything was created through him and for him. He existed before anything else, and he holds all creation together.” - Colossians 1:16-17
