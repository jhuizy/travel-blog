After all the angst and nerves, excitement has set in. We are off. Jobless and homeless we are now living our lives out of a backpack for at least the next 6 months.

So what do you take on a 6 month+ backpacking adventure? Well we are by no means an expert on this but hereâ€™s what weâ€™re taking.

Somewhere we read to pack once, then pack again but with a third of the stuff. With this in mind we started packing. And Iâ€™m glad we started packing early cause think it took us about 5 packs to just be able to fit our stuff in! But we got there in the end and weâ€™ll see how we manage. 

First stop Buenos Aires, Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·
