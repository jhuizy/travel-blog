Sunday 21st December 2019, after an obligatory selfie, we said good bye to our little housey we called home together for the past 7 months. Emotions running high (mainly stress and frustration trying to squeeze everything in the car) we took off on our first leg of our journey from Perth to Launceston.

Oh and I forgot to mention that our fur baby managed to squeeze her way into the car to come along for the ride üê∞
